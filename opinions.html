    <div class="question">
        > What editor do you use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I use <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> because it is extremely lightweight and highly customizable. I don't
        customize that much from the default config, but I love having the ability to do so. If you want to, check out my
        <a href="https://github.com/super-cooper/my-dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc">.vimrc</a> or my
        <a href="https://github.com/super-cooper/my-dotfiles/tree/master/.vim">plugins.</a> On Windows, I like to use
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> because it is lightweight and opens quickly. For a plain
        text editor on Windows, I rarely need to use it for more than making a few edits to a config file here and there.
        I use vim mainly on Linux, where I am mostly opening text files from the command line.

    <div class="question">
        > What IDE do you use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> IDEs almost exclusively. They are mostly known for making
        the popular Java IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA,</a> but if they support the
        language I'm using, I use their software. This is a pretty radical opinion, but I think JetBrains makes the best
        software in any context. It is incredibly feature-rich without being bloated, and wildly extensible. The only
        thing I don't like about it is that it isn't free and open source. If the language I am using is not supported
        by JetBrains software, I usually just go with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio Code</a>
        if there is a plugin for the language, and if not, I just go with vim and the command line.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What language is your favorite?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I enjoy writing in Python the most, since it's very simple and can be written as either a program or a script.
        Also, I find writing code "pythonically" lends itself to being very elegant. Python has a number of language
        features that I enjoy very much, and use liberally, such as list comprehensions and decorators. I also like that
        it is a true multi-paradigm language that takes full advantage of imperative, object-oriented, and functional
        philosophies. What I don't like about Python is that it is interpreted, duck-typed, and runs on a single thread.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What language do you dislike the most?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        All of them, including Python.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What operating system do you use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For most every day things like web browsing, programming, answering emails, what have you, I use
        <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux.</a> Specifically, I use the
        <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting">testing branch.</a> I like that it gets almost all of the
        software support that <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> gets without all of the corporate influence of
        <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical,</a> since Ubuntu is based on Debian, and I also like that it's much
        more up to date than the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable">stable branch.</a> I also have a computer
        that runs <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">Windows 10</a> that I use mainly for playing video
        games, making music, and watching Netflix.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What shell do you use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I use <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">ZSH</a> for regular shell interaction. I decided to switch after years of
        using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">BASH</a> because it is made more with user-focused
        customization in mind as opposed to complete open-endedness, although you can still take advantage of BASH-like
        customization most of the time if you want. I do still use BASH for my shell-scripting, though, because I
        believe it works better as a scripting language than ZSH.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > Do you only use free software?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Not at all, no. I use proprietary software if it's just better than the free alternative, but I try to use free
        software when I can. I generally prefer the philosophy and user-focused design of most free software, but I
        understand everyone's gotta make a living somehow!
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What do you use to make music?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I use <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a> for mixing, production, and synths and
        <a href="https://www.finalemusic.com/">Finale</a> for engraving. Most of the music I make is bad and can't
        really be categorized by a genre because most of it is just whatever nonsense passes through my head.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What do you play games on?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I play most online games on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>), but I also have a PS4,
        Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo 3DS.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        > What was your first game system?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        I had a SEGA Genesis, and I beat Sonic The Hedgehog probably hundreds of times.

        I am Adam Cooper, a 22 year old computer programmer from New Jersey. I currently am living in New York City, and
        I work at MongoDB as a backend developer on the Server Security team. I program mostly in C++. In my free time,
        I like to work on personal projects (both programming and non-programming, but mostly technology-related), play
        video games (particularly Rocket League!), watch/play baseball/softball, make/play music, watch movies, and cook!
        Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about any of these things, as long as you're not trying to sell me
        anything ;) <br><br>

        I try to keep more specific and/or personal information off of the internet, but if you want to know more about
        my interests, feel free to visit the <a href="opinions.html">opinions</a> page of my website.
